# Inference

-   The scores tend to remain within a similar range across different academic years, indicating consistent performance without significant changes in academic achievement as students progress.

<!-- -->

-   There isnâ€™t a strong upward or downward trend in scores from year to year, suggesting that the academic difficulty or grading criteria may be consistent across years.

-   Both genders exhibit similar score distributions, with no notable performance differences between male and female students, suggesting equality in academic achievement.

-   A few outliers appear in the lower score ranges, showing that while most students score in a middle-to-high range, a minority are achieving significantly lower scores.

-   The majority of scores are concentrated in the mid-to-high range, indicating that most students perform relatively well, with fewer instances of extremely low or extremely high scores.
